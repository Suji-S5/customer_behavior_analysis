# customer_behavior_analysis
Data Analytics project showcasing customer behavior analysis using Python, Sql and Power BI
--Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, from raw data ingestion to actionable insights and visualization. The goal is to analyze a dataset using Python and SQL, uncover key trends through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and present insights via a Power BI dashboard, a written report, and a presentation created with Gamma.

--Dataset

The dataset is loaded and processed using Python.

It contains structured data suitable for analysis and visualization.

Data quality issues such as missing values and inconsistencies are identified and resolved during the cleaning phase.

--Tools & Technologies

Python (Pandas) – Data loading, cleaning, and EDA

PostgreSQL – Data storage and SQL querying

SQL – Data extraction and analysis

Power BI – Interactive dashboard and visualizations

Gamma – Presentation (PPT) creation

Jupyter Notebook – Analysis and documentation

--Project Steps

Data Loading

Imported the dataset into Python using Pandas.

Loaded cleaned data into PostgreSQL for querying.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed distributions, trends, and relationships.

Identified outliers, missing values, and data inconsistencies.

Data Cleaning

Handled missing values and duplicates.

Standardized data types and formats.

Ensured data readiness for analysis and reporting.

SQL Analysis

Wrote SQL queries in PostgreSQL to answer business questions.

Performed aggregations, filtering, and joins.

Dashboard Development

Built an interactive Power BI dashboard.

Visualized key metrics and insights for stakeholders.

Reporting & Presentation

Created a structured analytical report.

Developed a professional presentation (PPT) using Gamma.

--Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard provides:

Key performance indicators (KPIs)

Trends and comparisons

Interactive filters for deeper analysis

--Results & Insights

Identified key patterns and trends within the data.

Generated insights that support data-driven decision-making.

Presented findings in a clear and stakeholder-friendly format.
